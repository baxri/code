This is what I found

## Boot time

To handle Boot time may be we can use this lib?

If there is a better solution to handle boot time lmk.

## Time in foreground/background
TO handle how many seconds app is in background may be this is a good library and make a little timer that starts when app goes to background and stops when app goes to foreground.

## Network requests, including backend API calls

For this task I think to is best way to log this data at one place where we send http requests and get response. But in the application there are many places where we are using just axios.post and axios.get without any wrapper function. what is the best way may be it is better at first to wrap all request in one wraper

## async storage access times (i.e. get and set item)

This is simple I think to start and finish trace before and after asyn function to get storage access time.


and also Do I have access on firebase console?
